# This provides documentation for the library

# Content #
The library has the following sub-libraries.
  * Copula
> > This provides access to three copulas, namely, Clayton, Frank and Gumbel.
  * csglm
> > CSGLM (Coupled Surface-Ground water Lumped Model) is a model developed for modelling linkage between surface and groundwater.

  * easy\_gw\_1d
> > This is an easy implementation of the one dimensional groundwater model. This data is pass to the module using the xls file and the output is also written in xls. You need not to know Python for using this module.

  * errlib
> > This provides some simple error indices e.g. rmse, bias, NS coefficient etc.

  * extract gis data
> > Useful for extracting data over few locations from multiple gis file.

  * gis
> > Some GIS tool e.g. conversion of coordinate system from latlong to UTM.

  * gw
> > Groundwater model.

  * krige
> > Variogram and Kriging analysis.

  * radarsat
> > Process RADARSAT-2 data.

  * rain\_disagg
> > Rainfall disaggregation model based on the random multiplicative cascade (RMC) approach.

  * richards
> > Numerical solution of Richards' equation in python.

  * soil\_texture
> > Provides the soil type and soil hydraulic properties based on pedotransfer function given the percentage of sand, silt and clay.

  * stats
> > Some statistical functions

  * sunlib
> > Modules to compute sunrise, sunset time etc.

  * xls
> > Read and write data to xls files.
